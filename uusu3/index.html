					<li>Then social activities according to weather: we'll have board games, there's a ice-skating facility close by and a hiking trail (and a sauna).</li>
					<li>Lunch</li>
					<li>Back to Uppsala and then to Stockholm. There'll be an astropub in Uppsala</li>
				</ul>
				<h3> Presentation format</h3>
				<p>
					We are very keen on working on presentation skills. For that purpose, speakers will be able to ask for feedback on their presentations if they wish too, and there'll be time allocated for that. <strong>Presentation are allocated 20 minutes maximum</strong> (if you want to do less, perfectly fine !), and there'll be an extra 10 minutes for discussion and eventual feedback.
					<strong>We will not have a projector for presentations.</strong> This will make us work on delivering a clear message to the audience. We'll have a big blackboard and you're also welcome to print handouts and circulate then if there is some image or plot you're dying to show to the audience! Please keep in mind that the audience is very diverse (we do very different kind of astronomy or space physics).

				<h2>Logistics</h2>
				<p>
					We'll have the meeting in a nice and cosy setting at the <a href="http://www.uppsalastudentkar.se/norredatorp" target="_blank">Norreda Torp</a> 25 km outside Uppsala. It's a set of old houses with sitting for 60-ish people.
				</p>
				<h3>Reaching Norreda torp</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Itinerary</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Norreda Torp can be approached by public transport and accessed by car. <strong>Stockholmers</strong> are encouraged to take the SJ train to Uppsala Centralstation, then the UL bus 809 (direction Knutby Skola) and <strong>stop at Funbo Kyrka</strong>. We will have cars to drive you between Funbo Kyrka and Norreda Torp at the beginning and the end of the meeting. You'll find a suggested itinerary from Stockholm to Uppsala below as well as the map of the central station area with the bus stops. The bus 809 leaves from the bus stop B2.

				<h3>Overnight stay</h3>
				<p>
					There will be beds for everyone. <strong>Everybody who stays overnight should bring their own bedding (sleeping bag or sheets / pillowcases)</strong>. Blankets are provided. If you are interested in the sauna, bring your towel with you. If you are interested in going walking in the nature/ice-skating bring good warm clothes with you!
				</p>
				<h3>Meals</h3>
				<p>
					We'll take care of meals (lunch/dinner on Thursday, breakfast/lunch on Friday) as well snacks and fika breaks.
